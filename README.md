# Ballance Blender Helper

This is a Blender plugin which is served for Ballance mapping.

WIP. Only BM export function is finished. But it is enough. Following function will be added in the future and it just like the decoration of BM export. Because once we have BM export, every map can be converted from Blender to Virtools.

BM file spec can be seen in [there](https://github.com/yyc12345/gist/tree/master/BMFileSpec)

Support criteria: Only support the lastest **LTS** version.

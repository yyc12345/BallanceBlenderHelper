# BBP NG

[中文版本](README_ZH.md)

BBP NG, abbr **B**allance **B**lender **P**lugin **N**ext **G**eneration.

## Brief Introduction

The next generation of original Ballance Blender Helper. This plugin is fully rewritten.  
This plugin still work in progress. The development will be pushed into `ng` branch in main repository. For legacy plugin user, please visit `master` branch directly.

## Develop Help

Use `pip install fake-bpy-module-latest==20230627` to install the type hint library for Blender. Because fake-bpy-module do not release official 3.6 package, we need install it by choosing the most closest version of Blender 3.6 release. That what I found.

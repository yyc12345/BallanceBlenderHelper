# Raw Icons

This folder contain all images used by this Blender plugin.

This folder should not be distributed in production because all of these files are in original size. It is pretty need too much time to load them in blender.  
So we keep these high quality images here and provide a tools in `tools` folder. Builder should run script to generate thumbnails in `icons` folder.  
Then this Blender plugin can work normally.
